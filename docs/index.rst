Wait, what is dploy?
--------------------

dploy is a deployment utility that is meant to be similar to systems like
heroku. It utilizes many similar technologies as heroku but allows for
customization at various points in the stack. dploy was designed for Blue Water
Ads, by `Reuven V. Gonzales <https://github.com/ravenac95>`_. Many components of
the dploy stack are provided as open sourced projects on github.
